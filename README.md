How to play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe:

The first player (red) plays to any empty square. 
The next player may play on any unowned square in the board whose position corresponds to the square chosen by the previous player.
Play continues in this manner, with play restricted to the board chosen by the previous player's square choice.
If you are sent to a board that is either owned by a player or completely full, you may play to any unowned, non-full board.
Play continues until a player wins 3 boards in a row or all boards are owned or full with no winner.

Playable boards are outlined in green, won boards are outlined in the owner's colour.
The last move is highlighted in a brighter version of the player's colour.

There are currently 3 difficulties at which the computer will play, getting progressively more difficult.
